        My doctoral work develops a general MSPD framework for multivariate
        self-exciting point processes. The aim is to capture complex,
        event-driven interactions across multiple components (e.g. cyber events
        across entities, climate shocks across regions) while retaining
        analytical tractability.

        Using Malliavin calculus on Poisson spaces, I obtain expressions for
        expectations, covariances and, more generally, functionals of shifted
        MSPD paths. This allows me to compute sensitivities and scenario
        impacts in a way that is both mathematically rigorous and aligned with
        risk management practice.

        In cyber risk, MSPDs provide a flexible tool to describe how incidents
        trigger further activity across time, business units, or entities. I am
        particularly interested in linking these dynamics to solvency
        constraints, loss distributions, and decision-relevant indicators.

        The interactive toy models presented on the home page are designed to
        communicate these ideas visually: one focuses on MSPD
        dynamics for cyber; the other highlights scenario-based stresses and shifted-path
        analysis, echoing the kind of "what-if" questions asked by boards and
        regulators.

        A central theme of my research agenda is to connect advanced stochastic
        models with the constraints of real internal models and regulatory
        frameworks (e.g. Solvency II). Pseudo-chaotic decompositions and
        shifted-path operators offer explicit contributions of different
        event-types and scenarios, which can be translated into stress testing
        tools for practitioners.

        In future work, I plan to extend these methods to climate-related and
        longevity risks, and to explore computational strategies (e.g.
        simulation-based inference, variance reduction) to scale MSPD-based
        models to larger data sets.
